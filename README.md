## morphax: Mathematical Morphology in JAX

Python package `jinnaxrphax` provides functions to train Mathematical Morphology models in`JAX`. It has the modules `data`, `dmnn` and `nn` for data processing, for performing discrete morphology and for neural morphological network training. Refer to `morphax` [documentation](https://raw.githack.com/dmarcondes/morphax/master/docs/morphax.html) for more details.

A tutorial of `morphax` is available at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dmarcondes/JINNAX/blob/master/Tutorial_PINN_simulation_with_JINNAX.ipynb).
